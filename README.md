Within the osTicket Help Desk I created and configured in the previous projects, I used one of the end-user accounts I created called "Karen" and created a ticket.

I assigned the ticket Help Topic to "Business Critical Outage" which was a topic I created in the previous osTicket Configuration project. "Sev-A" is top level priority and the property has a 1 hour response time fram and 24/7 availability which I classified for this ticket later as from the agent portal. In the title of the ticket Karen wrote "entire mobile/online banking system is down." and the description stated "My employees are reporting that users are no longer able to access the online. The ones who occasionally access it cannot log in."

I logged into the agent portal for the agent I created "John Doe" and reassigned the ticket to "Jane Doe/online banking" since she I put her as part of the "online banking" team. This is also where John set the SLA to "Sev-A
</p>

</p>
<p>
I started communicating with the guest user "Karen" as the Jane Doe agent from here on out. I was giving updates to the status of the situation and eventually gave the final update when the issue was resolved.

<p>
After the ticket was resolved I closed it through Jane Doe since she was reassigned to it. The ticket ended in the closed tab under another mock ticket I created with another guest user account known as "Ken".
